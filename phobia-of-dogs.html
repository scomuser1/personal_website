                <br><br>Fear of dogs is a widespread phobia globally. Despite being seen as loyal companions, many Indians in the UAE exhibit fear and anxiety around dogs. New expatriates should be aware of this and accommodate their Indian colleagues' or friends' fears by keeping their furry four-legged friends away from them, for the following reasons …
                <br><br>👉🏻Know the Facts
                <br><br>Did you know that there are over 60 million stray dogs in India leading to a huge shortage of ARV vaccine in public hospitals and a shooting price in private hospitals?
                <br><br>Did you know that stray dogs rule some of the streets and endanger people and children between the ages of 5 and 16?
                <br><br>Did you know that according to WHO estimates, 36% of global deaths by rabies happen in India, at 18,000-20,000 a year?
                <br><br>👉🏻Cultural Factors
                <br><br>India is a diverse country with a vast array of cultures and traditions. Some cultural beliefs and superstitions passed down through generations contribute to the fear of dogs. In certain communities, dogs are considered unclean or bringers of bad luck. This belief is rooted in ancient texts and customs, where dogs were associated with death and diseases. Consequently, individuals who adhere to such beliefs may develop a fear of dogs based on cultural teachings.
                <br><br>👉🏻Negative encounters
                <br><br>Being chased or bitten can leave lasting fear and trauma.
                <br><br>Personal experiences play a crucial role in shaping people's perceptions and fears of dogs. Additionally, inadequate exposure to dogs during the early years can lead to a lack of familiarity, causing anxiety around them. Negative experiences of attacks or aggressive behavior may also influence an individual's fear response especially when they must get shots for treatment.
                <br><br>👉🏻Religious Influences
                <br><br>Religion plays a significant role in shaping people's beliefs, and in India, religion is deeply ingrained in daily life. Hinduism, the dominant religion of the country, has mixed views on dogs. While some Hindus portray the dog as a symbol of loyalty and fidelity, others consider them impure or even demonic. The association of dogs with deities like Yama, the god of death, may further contribute to the fearsome Indians' experience.
                <br><br>👉🏻Lack of dog-friendly environment in India
                <br><br>The fear of dogs can also stem from a lack of dog-friendly environments and a general misunderstanding of canine behavior. In certain areas, dogs are not commonly kept as pets or are primarily used for security purposes. When individuals do not routinely encounter dogs in a familiar and positive setting, they may perceive them as threatening or unpredictable. This lack of exposure can contribute to fear and unease around dogs.
                <br><br>The fear of dogs for Indians is a complex issue shaped by cultural, religious, and personal factors. Understanding these factors here in the UAE is essential for promoting empathy and education within society. By dispelling myths, encouraging responsible pet ownership, and offering exposure to dogs in controlled and positive environments, we can help individuals overcome their fears. Encouraging open dialogue and generating awareness can contribute to a more inclusive and compassionate society where the fear of dogs is better understood and effectively addressed.
