                <br><br>In the novel "Everything I Never Told You" by Celeste Ng, the Chinese American family faces numerous struggles that stem from their complex identity and the pressures they face in American society during the 1970s. The narrative sheds light on themes such as racism, cultural assimilation, gender roles, and the burden of expectations.
                <br><br>One of the primary struggles of the Chinese-American family in the novel revolves around racism and cultural discrimination. The characters face constant prejudice and scrutiny due to their ethnic background. This discrimination is evident in the experience of Marilyn Lee, the mother of the family, who faces discrimination while pursuing her dream of becoming a doctor. She is often undermined and overlooked by her white classmates and professors, leading to feelings of isolation and self-doubt.
                <br><br>Another significant struggle the family faces is the tension between assimilation and preserving their cultural heritage. James Lee, the father, strives to fit into American society by downplaying his Chinese roots to assimilate better. On the other hand, Marilyn yearns to hold onto her cultural identity, creating a conflict within the family. 
                <br><br>Their mixed-race children, Nath and Lydia, also navigate the delicate balance between their Chinese heritage and American upbringing.
                <br><br>Gender roles are yet another struggle prevalent in the novel. Marilyn's desire to become a doctor is seen as unconventional and goes against societal expectations for women at that time. This creates tension in her marriage as her ambitions clash with James' traditional views on gender roles. Additionally, Lydia, their daughter, grapples with societal pressure to conform to expectations of femininity, which affects her emotional well-being and sense of self.
                <br><br>The burden of expectations weighs heavily on each family member. James, as the only son in his family, feels pressured to succeed and fulfill his parents' dreams. This pressure carries over to his relationship with Marilyn, as he places high expectations on her to prioritize family over pursuing her career. Conversely, Lydia faces immense pressure to meet her parents' expectations and become the embodiment of their unfulfilled dreams.
                <br><br>Celeste Ng exposed the struggles faced by the Chinese American family in "Everything I Never Told You" which serves as a reflection of the broader challenges that many immigrant families face in a society where cultural differences are often devalued. Through their story, the novel highlights the complexities, sacrifices, and resilience of a family striving to find their place in a multicultural world.
